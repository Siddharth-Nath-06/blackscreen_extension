# 🕶️ Blackout Tab - Chrome Extension

**Blackout Tab** is a minimal Chrome (and Chromium-based browser) extension that lets you **toggle a full black screen** over any tab with a single click. It also **changes the tab’s title and icon**, making it appear as a blank or inactive tab — perfect for quick privacy, focus, or a visual break.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 One-click toggle: Instantly cover the current tab with a full black screen.
- 🕵️ Disguises the tab: Changes the tab's **title** and **favicon** to generic or blank versions.
- 🖥️ Works seamlessly across Chrome and most Chromium-based browsers (like Brave, Edge, etc).
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast: Zero clutter, no background tracking, just pure utility.

## 🧩 Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing this repo.
5. Done! You’ll now see the extension icon in your toolbar.

## 🛠️ Usage

- Click the extension icon once to activate the blackout.
- Click again to return to the original tab content.
- The tab's title and icon will automatically switch while blackout is active.


## ⚙️ Permissions

The extension requires access to:

- `activeTab` – to apply changes on the currently open tab.
- `scripting` – to inject and toggle the blackout overlay.

## 🧪 Notes

- This extension is **not** meant for security purposes — it is a quick visual toggle for discretion or focus.
- Some websites with restrictive CSP (Content Security Policy) may prevent script injection.
